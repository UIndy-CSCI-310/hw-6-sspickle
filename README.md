## Original README

This week weâ€™re going to continue working in the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) framwork.

This week we'll incorporate some additional features/concepts so support more complex applications:

* [More Events](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/component-events)
* [Stores](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/writable-stores)
* [Transisions](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/transition)

# Requirements

- 20% Use a dispatch event in some way
- 20% Incorporate a Svelte writable store
