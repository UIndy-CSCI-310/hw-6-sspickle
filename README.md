# Homework Project 6

This week we’re going to continue working in the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) framwork.

This week we'll incorporate some additional features/concepts so support more complex applications:

* [More Events](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/component-events)
* [Stores](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/writable-stores)
* [Transisions](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/transition)

# Requirements

Points will be distributed as follows:

- 20% Use a dispatch event in some way
- 20% Incorporate a Svelte writable store
- 20% Apply some transition during interaction
- 20% Uses correct Typescript typing
- 20% Uses consistent and clean style

When you first start the codespace on GitHub, be sure to run:

    npm install
  
To install the packages. Also to run the web server:

    npm run dev
